This is the repo for my personal website. So far I'm pretty impressed with github pages, but once I get stuff running here, I'll most likely be switching to gitlab for my hosting, as they allow you to add security certificates for custom domains, though I may just continue to handle any sort of login capacity with external embedding.

To start with, I'm using a tool called [JekyllNow](http://www.jekyllnow.com/). It seems hard to make Jekyll any easier to work with, but it does save some time.

I have a lot of changes in the pipe for the template, so hopefully they'll be useful, and I'll link them in this README once they're decent.
