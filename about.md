## Hi, I'm Michael.##

I live in the San Francisco Bay Area and grew up in Maryland (the other Bay area), home of the [Star Spangled Banner](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-story-behind-the-star-spangled-banner-149220970/) and the [glorious blue crab](https://www.eater.com/2015/6/5/8640317/maryland-blue-crabs-where-to-eat). I love burritos, sun, hydration, and most dogs / people.

I am so grateful for the privileges and opportunity I have.

## Philosophy: People > Things##

I create things to serve people - electronics, software, businesses, art, food, and sometimes mischief. I also teach. Most of the time, I solve problems. In professional and personal capacities, I humbly stand by my oath under the Order of the Engineer. This means:

- practicing integrity and fair dealing
- exhibiting tolerance and respect
- committing to serve humanity and the enduring health of the planet
- refusing dishonest or harmful work
- readily giving my skill and knowledge when needed for the public good

While the inequality at the top of this section seems painfully obvious, my experience is that it's easily forgotten without continual effort and practice, so I strive to make it a conscious part of everything I do.
